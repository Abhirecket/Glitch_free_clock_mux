# Glitch_free_clock_mux
 The same logic function can occasionally be operated with multiple clock sources because of to clock multiplexing. This kind of reasoning may include errors that lead to functional issues. Timing issues may also arise due to the delay present in combinational logic. Numerous timing analysis and design rule check tools issue warnings when they encounter clock multiplexers.

 ### RTL Description: Glitch-Free Clock MUX

- **Module Name**: glitch_free_clock_mux
- **Inputs**:
  - `clk1`: Clock input 1.
  - `clk2`: Clock input 2.
  - `sel`: Selection signal to choose between the clock inputs.
  - `rst_n`: Active low asynchronous reset signal.
- **Outputs**:
  - `clk_out`: Output clock signal selected based on the `sel` input.
- **Internal Signals**:
  - `r_clk1_ff1`, `r_clk1_ff2`: Registers to synchronize `clk1`.
  - `r_clk2_ff1`, `r_clk2_ff2`: Registers to synchronize `clk2`.
  - `i_and1`, `i_and2`: Inputs to AND gates for clock selection.
  - `o_and1`, `o_and2`: Outputs of AND gates for clock selection.
- **Description**:
  - The `glitch_free_clock_mux` module selects one of the input clock signals (`clk1` or `clk2`) based on the selection signal `sel`.
  - Registers are used to synchronize both input clock signals to avoid metastability issues.
  - Two AND gates (`i_and1` and `i_and2`) are used to control the selection of the clock signals based on the `sel` input and the synchronized clock signals.
  - The selected clock signal (`clk_out`) is generated by ORing the outputs of the AND gates.
  - The synchronous reset signal `rst_n` is used to initialize the registers when asserted.
- **Dependencies**:
  - This module does not have any external dependencies.
- **Additional Comments**:
  - This design ensures glitch-free switching between the input clock signals, preventing glitches or spikes in the output clock signal during the transition.
